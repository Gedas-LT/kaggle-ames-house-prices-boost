# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

Second part of Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.

In the the first part I have done data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering and some modelling. The notebook URL: https://github.com/Gedas-LT/kaggle-ames-house-prices. 

This time the main aspect was a scikit-learn pipelines. All ideas about data cleaning and features engineering were taken from first part of competition.  

Custom functions used in the pipelines are defined in seperate file functions.py.
